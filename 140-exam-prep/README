There are two exam sets:

1. exam2016.scala.pdf from 2016 (along with the corresponding exam2016.scala
   file and, spoiler alert, exam2016solutions.scala file).  This is the exam
   actually used in 2016 in this course.

2. src/main/scala/examFake.scala (along with the corresponding solutions).
   This is a trial exam prepared in 2016.  It has the same scope and size as an
   actual exam. This one was never typeset in the PDF file, but all the questions
   are in comments.

3. The frontpage of the 2017 exam, so that you can familiarize yourself with
   the intro ahead of time. (exam2017frontpage.scala.pdf)

The build.sbt file and the library implementation files in these sbt project
are the same as will be used in the final exam.
